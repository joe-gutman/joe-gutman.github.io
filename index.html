            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! If you’re here, you’re probably looking to learn more about me. I’m Joe, a self-taught developer currently studying Computer Science at Western Governors University. My journey into tech actually started in graphic design and 3D modeling. I spent a lot of time building virtual experiences on platforms like Second Life. I loved making things people could actually use, but I always wanted to do more than just create static designs. I wanted them to be functional, to actually do something. So, I picked up coding to make that happen.</p>

            <p>At first, I started by tearing apart small scripts, figuring out how they worked, and then using what I learned to build my own. It was addictive. Eventually, I stumbled upon MIT's free Intro to Computer Science course, which focused on Python. I figured, why not? It was self-paced and I could do it on my own time. That course was the first time I really understood how code could power real applications. Not just animations or graphics, but tools that could respond to user input and perform real tasks. That got me hooked, and I just kept going from there.</p>
            
            <p>As I kept building small projects and experimenting with new ideas, I realized frontend development was only part of the story. If I wanted to make things that really worked end-to-end, I needed to understand the backend too. I tried learning it on my own, but it was a whole different skill set. It wasn’t as visual as design or as immediate as frontend work. That’s when a friend told me about Hack Reactor. I applied, got accepted, and spent 12 weeks learning to build full-stack applications from scratch. I learned how to connect the frontend with the backend, handle data, and create fully functional applications. It was also my first real experience working with a team. Up until then, I had mostly worked solo. Sharing tasks, coordinating ideas, and solving problems together was new, but I found out I really enjoyed it. There’s something rewarding about building something as a group and watching it come together.</p>
            
            <p>Since then, I’ve been focused on building tools that people can actually use. My latest project is a voice-powered virtual assistant that helps manage everyday tasks through natural conversation. It’s built with Python, Flask, and Godot, and it’s designed to prioritize privacy with an offline-first SQL backend. I also led a team to build <strong>Tabletop Tracker</strong>, an app for managing board game collections. We even added an AI-powered recommendation system to help users find their next favorite game.</p>
            
            <p>I’m always working to learn more and build better things. I want to be part of a team that’s creating real solutions that people actually use. If that’s what you’re working on, I’d love to help make it happen.</p>
